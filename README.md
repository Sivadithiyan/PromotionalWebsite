# PromotionalWebsite
A project to develop a website to display my musical accomplishments and contributions

## What is there thus far: 

A fully designed HTML page supported with css
A fully working drop down menu
A section for my socials
Color palette decided! (Gold and Black)

## Future Plans:

Add individual pages for each menu option
Add sample packs which are downloadable
Add "about me" page
Make it look nicer
Get a cloud support and host the server for public use

##Progress: 30%

##Note:

This is not my official website to show my technical achievements rather my musical achievements and updates. My very own introductory website is under construction
